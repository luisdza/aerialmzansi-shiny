The components below don't contain Shiny applications, but they do use Shinylive to load Pyodide and run Python code in the browser.

Please note that these are experimental and usage may change in the future.

### Editor and terminal

Run selected code or current line with ⌘/Ctrl-Enter; run the entire file with ⌘/Ctrl-Shift-Enter.

:::{.column-page-inset-right}
```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, terminal]

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

sums = map(add, [1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6])
list(sums)

```
:::


### Notebook-style cell


```{shinylive-python}
#| components: [editor, cell]
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

list(map(add, [2, 3], [4, 5]))
```
